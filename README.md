This repository will contain the source code used in my dissertation "Metameric Representations in Evolutionary Algorithms", as well as subsequent publications. I am in the process of cleaning up the code and will upload it soon. If you are interested in this work and would like the code sooner please email me (ryerkerk@msu.edu).
